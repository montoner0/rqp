@AboutPlugin
$ #About#

   #Really Quick Player (RQP)# is a simple "audio player" plugin for Far Manager which helps to pre-listen and sort sound files.

   Its main goal is a work with sound files as files and not being another multipurpose player. That's why it doesn't have a playlist, equaliser and any other redundant functionality. But it has the following features which could really help with sorting of audio files:
   - (de)select files on the Far's panel during a playback
   - demo-mode with a partial tracks playback
   - add files to an external playlist or playback them with an external player

    See ~"Usage"~@Usage@ section for additional information about the plugin capabilities.

@Usage
$ #Usage#

    #Launch#
    You can launch the plugin either from a Far's plugins menu or a command line using #rqp:#
prefix. Cursor should be positioned on an audio file when runing from the plugins menu and for
the command line a file name (or stream URL) should be passed as a parameter.
Playback will start automatially.

    In case of issues with a playback there are two possible scenarios:
    - a file is opened through the command line or the plugins menu: error message appears;
    - a file is opened within the plugin (e. g. next/previous button): error is supressed and the file skipped.

    #Usage#
    If you've seen a UI for any audio player then you shouldn't have any problems. You can click
on buttons and sliders with mouse or use keyboard. See ~"Controls"~@Controls@ topic for details.
    Plugin can work not only with a real file panel but also with any panels which have full
paths to a real files (like the temporary panel). Also completely virtual panels are supported (e.g.
archives) with some limitations.
    To use it with macros the plugin dialog has GUID {57C8067C-CB36-49B7-8E06-60AF0150FD4A}.

@ExtPlayer
$ #Using an external player#

    There is a possibility to run an external player (in fact - any application) with specified
parameters and the current file name. E. g. you can easily add current file to a playlist of
the external player or start a playback.
    Button #"Ext. player"# is responsible for this. Clicking on it first time opens
a menu with settings for a path to player and its parameters for addition and playback. The file name
in parameters should be specified as #%s#. Environment variables are supported in the player's path and
parameters.
   In the menu you can select with #Space# a default action for the button #"Ext. player"# which will be
used for the left click (the button's name will show the name of action). To open the configuration menu
in this case #right# click on the button.
